Introduction

PsychSim Gui can be used to run custom simulation scripts. These scripts can be generic but must follow a few rules (outlined below). Once the simulation is run, the results are stored internally and can be saved to disk as a pickle file. Data can be sampled and in turn, queried with custom functions that can be defined by the user. These queries can then be plotted.
